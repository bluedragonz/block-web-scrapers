Block Web Scrapers
==================

Advanced scrapers will always find a way to scrape publicly available content.
But we can at least make them work for it, and novice scrapers usually give up
when they run into too many roadblocks.

Blocks:
- Non-browser useragents
- Empty useragents
- Known proxy subnets
- Known scraper subnets
- Amazon EC2

Several frequently abused server hosts are blocked, but there is little reason

for servers on their networks to be visiting your website in the first place.
